				I am a third-year, undergraduate student at Duke University studying computer science and creative writing. I hope to one day combine my technical skillset with my creativity and love for the arts. Beyond code, writing, and photography, I can be found jamming out with the Duke University Marching Band at all our football and basketball games. Other interests include playing guitar, hiking, watching comedy, and reading short stories.<br><br>

				Explore this site to discover my coding projects, assorted publications, and photos. Message me if you are interested in hiring me or if you just want to chat! I am always interested in pursuing new projects as well as talking about anything such as your favorite data structure, Game of Thrones theories, and even the use of oxford commas. Otherwise, to learn more about me, just click <b class="toggler" id="extender">HERE.</b> Thanks for visiting!

				<!-- Born in South Korea but raised in Southern California, I am now a student in Durham, North Carolina. Above is a picture of me in Chefchaouen, Morocco!<br><br>

				I discovered my love for computer science in my Data Structures and Algorithms course during the fall of my freshman year. Though I did have prior exposure to code, the class and its hands-on projects demonstrated the immense impact technology can have on the world. I am inspired by computer science's endless applications and its ability to shape our everyday life for the better. Since my first semester, besides my regular coursework, I have also worked on personal projects and participated in hackathons.<br><br>

				As a writer, I have an extensive background in journalism. My experiences include serving as an editor in both my high school newspaper and yearbook and writing for Duke's <i>The Chronicle</i> as a biweekly columnist. Moreover, I maintained a weekly blog during my study abroad in Morocco. I was fortunate to have one of my posts republished by both <a href="http://islamicommentary.org/2015/06/brandon-choi-my-experiences-as-a-korean-american-in-morocco/"><u>ISLAMiCommentary</u></a> and <a href="https://global.duke.edu/experiencing-morocco-korean-american"><u>Duke Global.</u></a><br><br>
