						VOOGASalad stands for Video Object Oriented Game Architecture Salad (based on GameSalad, a mobile game engine). It is the largest project I have worked on and was about a month and a half long final assignment in my software class. We designed a game engine, game authoring envirionment, and game player. By the end, our program allowed users to build and customize their own tower defense games and simple RPGs. From there, the engine and player were able to load and allow users to play any of the created games.

						This past summer, I decided to create an online portfolio to display my projects, wriings, and photography. After returning from my time abroad in Morocco, I wanted to have a productive rest of the summer. I learned and utilized jQuery for the first time. Moreover, this was my first web project to use any Javascript. Be on the lookout for any updates and changes to my website.

						As a member of Cooper House, a selective living group at Duke, I was in charge of designating the weekly lunch pairings between members. Tired of using excel to randomize numbers and then match members, I decided to write a software program for this. Interested in the rising popularity of Scala, I decided to try it out for this project.

						SLogo stands for Simple Logo. This was one of my first software projects to involve a team. In a group of four, we designed and implemented an IDE. It was able to control a turtle on the screen via commands such as FORWARD, BACK, etc. Moreover, the IDE was capable of handling for loops and basic mathematic computations.

						This was my first assignment in CS308: Software Design & Implementation. While I did have prior experience with Java, this game was my first project to utilize JavaFX. In addition, this project challenged me to experiment with user interfaces and front-end design. Though my coding abilities and knowledge of OO design have improved <b>DRASTICALLY</b> since then, this was a really fun way to begin my software course.
